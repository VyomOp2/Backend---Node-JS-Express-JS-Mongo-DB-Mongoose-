# VDTube Backend Series

## 1. Introduction to Backend Development

### What is a Backend?

The backend, often referred to as the server-side of an application, is the part of the software that handles data storage, manipulation, and retrieval. It ensures that the client-side (frontend) receives the correct data in the desired format. The backend is responsible for the business logic, database interactions, authentication, and more.

### Structure and Model of Backend

The backend structure typically consists of three main components:
1. **Server**: The server is the core of the backend, processing client requests and sending appropriate responses. In this series, we'll be using Node.js, a powerful and scalable JavaScript runtime, to build our server.
2. **Database**: The database is where all the data is stored. We will be using MongoDB, a NoSQL database, known for its flexibility and scalability. Mongoose, an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, will be used to interact with our MongoDB database.
3. **Application Logic**: This includes all the backend logic such as routing, middleware, and controllers. We'll use the Express framework to handle these aspects, enabling us to build robust and maintainable backend applications.

For detailed information, you can refer to the official documentation : 

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/), 
[Express](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html), 
[MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/), 
[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html).

In this series, we'll cover various projects that will give you hands-on experience in backend development using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. Let's get started on building the backbone of VDTube!
